obsidian-dynamic-sheets
=======================

This is a playground to learn how to set up dynamic character sheets for Obsidian Portal. I'm planning on using:

- SCSS for the stylesheets
- Assemble for keeping the Portal code and the actual sheet HTML separate
- RequireJS and maybe Acorn for bundling any custom scripts
